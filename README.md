# Unspoken with Synthizer
Unspoekn is an add-on which was originally created by Austin Hicks (Camlorn), which plays sounds in 3D to represent controls on the screen rather than speaking control types with speech.

This is a version of Unspoken that works with Python 3 versions of NVDA and uses Synthizer. It works, however be warned of the following:

* NVDA will not start a lot of the time, not sure why yet.
* the event_becomeNavigatorObject was throwing errors, so disabled for now. This means that browse mode doesn't play sounds.
